# Insert Shift Array

## Challenge
- Create Node and Linked List Classes
- insert function to insert value into linked lists
- includes function to check linked list for a particular value
- print function to print all values in linked list

## Approach and Efficiency
Create a package called linkedlist. Within package create separate node and linked lists classes. Within the node class, instantiate the node with what type of data will be its possible values. Within the linked lists class, instantiate an empty list. Write all functions within the linked list class. 

## Solution 
- [Code](../../src/main/java/code401Challenges/linkedlist)
- Whiteboard (not applicable for lab)
